# Rocket Crash

Another overengineered piece of crap whose main reason is to utilise the tech. I'm essentially walking around with a lot of hammers and finding nails

## Synopsis

Going to render some rockets in the server, then calculate collisions via the client and finallly update the database with where the collisions happened.

## Why? 

I think rendering a game with lots of data coming is a great way to test the working systems. Also every job in the world demands something different, so I'm hoping to excite the people reviewing my application with this. 

If you're reading this. Hire me. I do things
