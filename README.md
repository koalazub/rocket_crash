# Rocket Crash

Another overengineered piece of crap whose main reason is to utilise the tech. I'm essentially walking around with a lot of hammers and finding nails

## Synopsis

Going to render some rockets in the server, then calculate collisions via the client and finallly update the database with where the collisions happened.

## Why? 

I think rendering a game with lots of data coming is a great way to test the working systems. Also every job in the world demands something different, so I'm hoping to excite the people reviewing my application with this. 

There is also the understanding for HTTP networks and how they work. I'm looking to delve deeper into understanding networking and interactions therein.


## Goals

- [ ] Learn about UDP, HTTP, Quic.
- [ ] Learn about interactions between edge databases such as Turso
- [ ] Better understand the rendering process in the browser
- [ ] Grok RPC networks, specifically `capnp`
- [ ] Create a proper full stack web project with the tech stack that I want
- [ ] Make rockets smash into each other
